### Generic Planar Robots

In this package, generic urdf robots and a panda gym environment are available.

## Dependencies

This package depends on casadi for dynamics generation and gym.
Dependencies should be installed through pip installation, see below.

## Installation
```bash
pip3 install -e .
```

## Switching

Environments can be created using the normal gym syntax.
For example the below code line creates a planar robot with 3 links and a constant k.
Actions are torques to the individual joints.
```python
env = gym.make('nLink-urdf-reacher-vel-v0', n=3, dt=0.01, render=True)
```

A holonomic and a differential drive mobile manipulator are implemented:
```python
env = gym.make('albert-reacher-vel-v0', dt=0.01, render=True)
env = gym.make('mobile-reacher-tor-v0', dt=0.01, render=True)
```
For most robots, different control interfaces are available, velocity control,
acceleration control and torque control.

## Robot control with the keyboard 
Control robot actuators with keyboard keys. This is done by:
* setting up a parent en child process with a pipe connection inbetween
* setup and start main process with parent_connection as arguement
* setup Responder object with child_connection as arguement
* start Responder with parent process as arguement

In the main loop an request for action should be made followed by wainting
for a response as such:
```python
parent_conn.send({"request_action": True})
keyboard_data = parent_conn.recv()
action = keyboard_data["action"]
```
this feature requires extra dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -e .[keyboard_input]
```

An example can be found in ./urdfGymExamples/keyboard_input_example.py
